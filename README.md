<h2>Say hello to SnowCord</h2>
<p>SnowCord is a mobile discord client built using TypeScript and React Native, it gives way more control to the user in terms of what they could do. <i>It's also better for privacy then the normal Discord client lol</i></p>

<h3>Key features ✨</h3>

- Support for custom themes and plugins that anyone can make using our framework

- Most nitro mobile features for free (<i>custom emotes anywhere using embeads and profile themes using 3y3 just to name some of them</i>)

- Better for privacy due to the fact that most of Discord's built in analytics and crash report features aren't included at all!

- Music RPC support for mobile music players <i>Other then Spotify</i>
